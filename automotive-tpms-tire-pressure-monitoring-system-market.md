<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive TPMS (Tire-Pressure Monitoring System) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Tire-Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) enhance vehicle safety by continuously monitoring tire pressure. There are two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses pressure sensors located in each tire to provide real-time data, alerting drivers of low pressure immediately. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, estimates tire pressure using wheel speed sensors and the vehicle's electronic stability control system, relying on variations in tire rotation to detect pressure changes. Both systems aim to prevent tire-related accidents.</p></p>
